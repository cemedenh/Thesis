	abstract = {Laser excitation of nanometer-sized atomic and molecular clusters offers various opportunities to explore and control ultrafast many-particle dynamics. Whereas weak laser fields allow the analysis of photoionization, excited-state relaxation, and structural modifications on these finite quantum systems, large-amplitude collective electron motion and Coulomb explosion can be induced with intense laser pulses. This review provides an overview of key phenomena arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical excitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current understanding. A general survey covers basic cluster properties and excitation mechanisms relevant for laser-driven cluster dynamics. Then, after an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single-photon and multiphoton excitations are reviewed with emphasis on signatures from time- and angular-resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The implications for technical developments such as the controlled generation of ion, electron, and radiation pulses will be addressed along with corresponding examples. Finally, future prospects of laser-cluster research as well as experimental and theoretical challenges are discussed.},

Analytical and numerical calculations are employed and compared in order to determine the plasmonic fields in gold ellipsoidal nanoparticles. The comparison indicates that numerical calculations can accurately predict the field enhancement and plasmonic decay, but may encounter difficulties when attempting to predict the oscillatory behavior of the plasmonic field. Numerical calculations for coupled symmetric and asymmetric ellipsoids for different carrier-envelope phases ({CEPs}) of the driving laser field are combined with time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations to predict the resulting {HHG} spectra. The studies reveal that the plasmonic field oscillations, which are controlled by the {CEP} of the driving laser field, play a more important role than the nanostructure configuration in finding the optimal conditions for the generation of isolated attosecond {XUV} pulses via nanoplasmonic field enhancement.},

Thus the helium-droplet technique combines the benefits of both the gas phase and the classical matrix-isolation techniques. Most important, the superfluid helium facilitates binary encounters, and absorbs the released binding energy upon recombination. Thus the droplet can be viewed as an isothermal nanoscopic reactor, which isolates single molecules, clusters, or even a single reactive encounter at ultralow temperatures.},

	abstract = {The infrared spectrum of single oxygen carbon sulfide ({OCS}) molecules was measured inside large superfluid pure helium-4 droplets and nonsuperfluid pure helium-3 droplets, both consisting of about 104 atoms. In the helium-4 droplets, sharp rotational lines were observed, whereas in helium-3 only a broad peak was found. This difference is interpreted as evidence that the narrow rotational lines, which imply free rotations, are a microscopic manifestation of superfluidity. Upon addition of 60 helium-4 atoms to the pure helium-3 droplets, the same sharp rotational lines were found; it appears that 60 is the minimum number needed for superfluidity.},

	abstract = {Although helium is normally a liquid to absolute zero, it can be solidified by the application of moderately high pressures. This transformation is of particular interest, since by the third law of thermodynamics the entropy difference between the liquid and the solid must disappear as the absolute zero is approached. This can most easily be shown by the disappearance of the heat of melting. Measurements from 1.0° to 1.8° of the slope of the melting pressure curve and the change in the molar volume of helium on melting are described, from which the heat of melting and the change in internal energy on melting were calculated. These results verify the predictions made by the third law. The measurements are also combined with those due to earlier workers to show the discontinuities in the various thermodynamic functions at the intersection of the λ-point-pressure curve with the melting pressure curve.},

Famous scientists such as Joule, Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Clausius, Maxwell or Boltzmann shared this forum. Not always in the most friendly manner. It is interesting to find out, how difficult it was to describe in a scientific (mathematical) language a phenomenon like “heat”, to see, how long it took to arrive at one of the fundamental principles in physics: entropy. Scientific progress started from the simple rule of Boyle and Mariotte dating from the late eighteenth century and arrived in the twentieth century with the concept of probabilities. Thermodynamics was the driving intellectual force behind the industrial revolution, behind the enormous social changes caused by this revolution. The history of thermodynamics is a fascinating story, which also gives insights into the mechanism that seem to govern science.},

The doping process of helium nanodroplets with alkali atoms has been modeled in order to study deviations from the Poissonian statistics of measured pick-up statistics which are important for assigning cluster or complex sizes in many experimental studies. Several, formally unexplained findings are reproduced and their origin has been analyzed: derivations from the expected functional form of the initial incline, the suppression of the formation of lithium clusters, the influence of the functional form and width of droplet size distributions. Furthermore, the controversially discussed formation of high-spin alkali clusters on helium droplets has been calculated within the model. The selection of high-spin states comes out to depend strongly on the experimental conditions, and is in general not pronounced for cluster sizes ≥ 3. The enhancement factor of 50 of high-spin states reported in earlier experiments is reproduced when choosing the conditions of these experiments.},

	abstract = {One of the simplest, and most completely treated, fields of application of quantum mechanics is the theory of atoms with one or two electrons. For hydrogen and the analcgous ions He+, Li++, etc., the calculations can be performed exactly, both in Schrödinger’s nonrelativistic wave mechanics and in Dirac’s relativistic theory of the electron. More specifically, the calculations are exact for a single electron in a fixed Coulomb potential. Hydrogen-like atoms thus furnish an excellent way of testing the validity of quantum mechanics. For such atoms the correction terms due to the motion and structure of atomic nuclei and due to quantum electrodynamic effects are small and can be calculated with high accuracy. Since the energy levels of hydrogen and similar atoms can be investigated experimentally to an astounding degree of accuracy, some accurate tests of the validity of quantum electrodynamics are also possible. Finally, the theory of such atoms in an external electric or magnetic field has also been developed in detail and compared with experiment.},

	abstract = {First experiments on atomic photoionization and molecular dissociation have been performed by taking advantage of the unprecedented characteristics of the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg ({FLASH}) combined with a separate near-infrared ({NIR}) femtosecond laser. In a series of two-color experiments, the photoionization of rare gases in the presence of a strong {NIR} dressing ﬁeld as well as the polarization dependence of this process were investigated systematically. A detailed analysis of the partial cross sections for the two-color two-photon ionization process was carried out for low dressing ﬁelds. Higher dressing ﬁelds give rise to multi-photon processes, which are observed and analyzed without undesirable interferences, a beneﬁcial consequence of the monochromaticity of the {FLASH} radiation. The experimental results are compared with theoretical descriptions for two-color above threshold ionization obtained by employing second-order perturbation theory and the ”soft-photon” approximation. In addition, complementary information was obtained on the sequential two-photon double ionization of Ne, which was made possible by the short and intense {FLASH} pulses. As a starting point for future time-resolved studies on molecular dissociation, a proof-of-principle experiment on the hydrogen diatomic system was carried out. In a typical pump-probe arrangement, excited neutral fragments, which were formed during photo-induced dissociation by the {FLASH} radiation, were identiﬁed via single- and multi-photon ionization induced by the time delayed optical laser.},

The third part provides useful reference data, including wavefunctions, special theory, polarization and special aspects of instrumentation. A detailed reference list completes the volume. The study of electron spectrometry using synchrotron radiation is a growing field of research driven by the increasing availability of advanced synchrotron radiation light sources and improved theoretical methods for solving the many-electron problem in atoms. This balanced account will be of value to both theorists and experimentalists working in this area.},
