	abstract = {Laser excitation of nanometer-sized atomic and molecular clusters offers various opportunities to explore and control ultrafast many-particle dynamics. Whereas weak laser fields allow the analysis of photoionization, excited-state relaxation, and structural modifications on these finite quantum systems, large-amplitude collective electron motion and Coulomb explosion can be induced with intense laser pulses. This review provides an overview of key phenomena arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical excitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current understanding. A general survey covers basic cluster properties and excitation mechanisms relevant for laser-driven cluster dynamics. Then, after an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single-photon and multiphoton excitations are reviewed with emphasis on signatures from time- and angular-resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The implications for technical developments such as the controlled generation of ion, electron, and radiation pulses will be addressed along with corresponding examples. Finally, future prospects of laser-cluster research as well as experimental and theoretical challenges are discussed.},

Analytical and numerical calculations are employed and compared in order to determine the plasmonic fields in gold ellipsoidal nanoparticles. The comparison indicates that numerical calculations can accurately predict the field enhancement and plasmonic decay, but may encounter difficulties when attempting to predict the oscillatory behavior of the plasmonic field. Numerical calculations for coupled symmetric and asymmetric ellipsoids for different carrier-envelope phases ({CEPs}) of the driving laser field are combined with time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations to predict the resulting {HHG} spectra. The studies reveal that the plasmonic field oscillations, which are controlled by the {CEP} of the driving laser field, play a more important role than the nanostructure configuration in finding the optimal conditions for the generation of isolated attosecond {XUV} pulses via nanoplasmonic field enhancement.},

Thus the helium-droplet technique combines the benefits of both the gas phase and the classical matrix-isolation techniques. Most important, the superfluid helium facilitates binary encounters, and absorbs the released binding energy upon recombination. Thus the droplet can be viewed as an isothermal nanoscopic reactor, which isolates single molecules, clusters, or even a single reactive encounter at ultralow temperatures.},

	abstract = {The infrared spectrum of single oxygen carbon sulfide ({OCS}) molecules was measured inside large superfluid pure helium-4 droplets and nonsuperfluid pure helium-3 droplets, both consisting of about 104 atoms. In the helium-4 droplets, sharp rotational lines were observed, whereas in helium-3 only a broad peak was found. This difference is interpreted as evidence that the narrow rotational lines, which imply free rotations, are a microscopic manifestation of superfluidity. Upon addition of 60 helium-4 atoms to the pure helium-3 droplets, the same sharp rotational lines were found; it appears that 60 is the minimum number needed for superfluidity.},

	abstract = {Although helium is normally a liquid to absolute zero, it can be solidified by the application of moderately high pressures. This transformation is of particular interest, since by the third law of thermodynamics the entropy difference between the liquid and the solid must disappear as the absolute zero is approached. This can most easily be shown by the disappearance of the heat of melting. Measurements from 1.0° to 1.8° of the slope of the melting pressure curve and the change in the molar volume of helium on melting are described, from which the heat of melting and the change in internal energy on melting were calculated. These results verify the predictions made by the third law. The measurements are also combined with those due to earlier workers to show the discontinuities in the various thermodynamic functions at the intersection of the λ-point-pressure curve with the melting pressure curve.},

Famous scientists such as Joule, Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Clausius, Maxwell or Boltzmann shared this forum. Not always in the most friendly manner. It is interesting to find out, how difficult it was to describe in a scientific (mathematical) language a phenomenon like “heat”, to see, how long it took to arrive at one of the fundamental principles in physics: entropy. Scientific progress started from the simple rule of Boyle and Mariotte dating from the late eighteenth century and arrived in the twentieth century with the concept of probabilities. Thermodynamics was the driving intellectual force behind the industrial revolution, behind the enormous social changes caused by this revolution. The history of thermodynamics is a fascinating story, which also gives insights into the mechanism that seem to govern science.},

The doping process of helium nanodroplets with alkali atoms has been modeled in order to study deviations from the Poissonian statistics of measured pick-up statistics which are important for assigning cluster or complex sizes in many experimental studies. Several, formally unexplained findings are reproduced and their origin has been analyzed: derivations from the expected functional form of the initial incline, the suppression of the formation of lithium clusters, the influence of the functional form and width of droplet size distributions. Furthermore, the controversially discussed formation of high-spin alkali clusters on helium droplets has been calculated within the model. The selection of high-spin states comes out to depend strongly on the experimental conditions, and is in general not pronounced for cluster sizes ≥ 3. The enhancement factor of 50 of high-spin states reported in earlier experiments is reproduced when choosing the conditions of these experiments.},

	abstract = {One of the simplest, and most completely treated, fields of application of quantum mechanics is the theory of atoms with one or two electrons. For hydrogen and the analcgous ions He+, Li++, etc., the calculations can be performed exactly, both in Schrödinger’s nonrelativistic wave mechanics and in Dirac’s relativistic theory of the electron. More specifically, the calculations are exact for a single electron in a fixed Coulomb potential. Hydrogen-like atoms thus furnish an excellent way of testing the validity of quantum mechanics. For such atoms the correction terms due to the motion and structure of atomic nuclei and due to quantum electrodynamic effects are small and can be calculated with high accuracy. Since the energy levels of hydrogen and similar atoms can be investigated experimentally to an astounding degree of accuracy, some accurate tests of the validity of quantum electrodynamics are also possible. Finally, the theory of such atoms in an external electric or magnetic field has also been developed in detail and compared with experiment.},

In a series of two-color experiments, the photoionization of rare gases in the presence of a strong {NIR} dressing ﬁeld as well as the polarization dependence of this process were investigated systematically. A detailed analysis of the partial cross sections for the two-color two-photon ionization process was carried out for low dressing ﬁelds. Higher dressing ﬁelds give rise to multi-photon processes, which are observed and analyzed without undesirable interferences, a beneﬁcial consequence of the monochromaticity of the {FLASH} radiation. The experimental results are compared with theoretical descriptions for two-color above threshold ionization obtained by employing second-order perturbation theory and the ”soft-photon” approximation. In addition, complementary information was obtained on the sequential two-photon double ionization of Ne, which was made possible by the short and intense {FLASH} pulses. As a starting point for future time-resolved studies on molecular dissociation, a proof-of-principle experiment on the hydrogen diatomic system was carried out. In a typical pump-probe arrangement, excited neutral fragments, which were formed during photo-induced dissociation by the {FLASH} radiation, were identiﬁed via single- and multi-photon ionization induced by the time delayed optical laser.},

The third part provides useful reference data, including wavefunctions, special theory, polarization and special aspects of instrumentation. A detailed reference list completes the volume. The study of electron spectrometry using synchrotron radiation is a growing field of research driven by the increasing availability of advanced synchrotron radiation light sources and improved theoretical methods for solving the many-electron problem in atoms.

This ﬁeld is reached at an irradiance of approximately 3 × 1016 W cm−2. The normal perturbative photon-by-photon based picture of the interaction of individual electrons with the ﬁeld is replaced by a tunnelling picture in which, in a time of the order of, or less than one optical cycle, atomic wavepackets are generated which escape the conﬁning Coulomb potential. These wavepackets are strongly inﬂuenced by the laser, ‘quiver’ and may be accelerated back to the parent ion in a recollision process. Phase-coherent effects locked to the laser ﬁeld become important: high harmonics are generated from these recollisions. We discuss the theory of such effects, and review progress in understanding how this quiver motion can be coherently controlled. We discuss ionization dynamics and review mechanisms by which atoms may be stabilized in very strong ﬁelds. Finally, we discuss relativistic effects which occur at very high-intensities.},

The spectrum of the “direct” electrons with intermediate energies prominently features both intracycle and intercycle interferences. We derive a simple analytic expression for this spectral range based on a semiclassical approximation of the time-dependent distorted wave strong-field approximation generalized to strong-field ionization by a two-color pulse. We verify its applicability to approximately represent the intricate interference patterns by comparison with the exact solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and with the strong-field approximation. We show that the interference patterns can be tuned and its contrast enhanced by the additional “knob” available, the relative phase between the two frequency components. The present results confirm that two-color ionization allows resolving interference structures originating from trajectories launched within a time interval of less than 100 as [X. Xie et al., Phys.

The book begins with a brief introduction to the traditional view of electron shells and their properties, and then goes on to discuss Rydberg states, quantum defect theory, atomic f-values, centrifugal barrier effects, autoionisation, inner shell and double excitation spectra, K-matrix theory, atoms in high laser fields, statistical methods, quantum chaos, and atomic effects in solids. The emphasis is throughout on radial properties, orbital collapse, many body effects, the breakdown of the independent particle approach, the emergence of chaos, and the behaviour of atoms inside clusters and solids. A very full account of autoionisation includes not only the standard treatment for isolated resonances, but also several alternative approaches. The book discusses many experimental examples and has many diagrams and a comprehensive reference list.},

The simulations are performed in the frozen geometry approximation for fixed ionic charges, so that only the evolution of the electrons, which are unbound to the ions, is examined. The dependence of the ionization efficiency on the laser frequency and cluster radius is manifested by pronounced maxima. The presence of these maxima favors the quasiresonance ionization mechanism, which is related to the motion of the unbound electrons in the entire cluster. The high level of ionization (q∼8–18 per atom) is realized in the expanded cluster, due to the Coulomb explosion.},

So far, most work in the field of nonlinear processes has been restricted to infrared, visible and ultraviolet light1, although progress in the development of X-ray lasers has been made recently2. With the advent of a free-electron laser in the soft-X-ray regime below 100 nm wavelength3, a new light source is now available for experiments with intense, short-wavelength radiation that could be used to obtain deeper insights into the structure of matter. Other free-electron sources with even shorter wavelengths are planned for the future. Here we present initial results from a study of the interaction of soft X-ray radiation, generated by a free-electron laser, with Xe atoms and clusters. We find that, whereas Xe atoms become only singly ionized by the absorption of single photons, absorption in clusters is strongly enhanced. On average, each atom in large clusters absorbs up to 400 {eV}, corresponding to 30 photons. We suggest that the clusters are heated up and electrons are emitted after acquiring sufficient energy. The clusters finally disintegrate completely by Coulomb explosion.},

	abstract = {Laser ionization of noble gases was studied with a 1.053-μm, 1-psec Nd:glass laser. A systematic scan of intensities from mid-1013 W/cm2 to mid-1016 W/cm2 was performed, resulting in the production of charge states as high as Xe12+. Ionization occurs exclusively in the tunneling regime. We compare experimental ion production rates with those predicted by several different theories. Agreement between experimental ion-production curves and theoretical predictions is good for two theoretical models: (1) an elaboration of the Keldysh tunneling model, developed by Ammosov et al. [ Sov. Phys. {JETP}64, 1191 ( 1986)] and (2) a much more primitive model, based on Coulomb-barrier suppression, in which tunneling and other quantum-mechanical effects are ignored completely. The success of the more primitive model suggests that a new term, barrier-suppression ionization, rather than tunneling or multiphoton ionization, may be the most appropriate at this wavelength and in this range of intensities.},

	title = {Reaction Between Barium and N2O on Large Neon Clusters},
	isbn = {978-3-642-63150-4},
	abstract = {Over the past few years, we have developed in our laboratory a new method called {CICR} (for “cluster isolated chemical reactions”), with the goal of investigating the effect of a reaction medium on reaction dynamics [1, 2, 3]. {CICR} consists in performing chemical reactions on large van der Waals clusters in a very controlled way. Clusters provide an ideal medium for the study of solvation effects and heterogeneous chemistry at a microscopic level. They are free from any perturbation due to a substrate, they have a well-defined internal energy and they have a finite size (from 102 to a few 103 atoms or molecules in our experiments). Reactants are deposited on the clusters by sticky collisions between the clusters and a low-pressure buffer gas [4]. This pick-up technique allows us to have strict control over the reactant deposition onto the clusters. On the clusters, reactants will migrate, collide with each other and eventually react. Thus the clusters become true chemical nanoreactors. Reactions of Ba atoms and small Ba aggregates have already been investigated on various clusters, i.e. argon, methane and nitrogen clusters which have similar structures and internal temperatures (between 35 and 43 K) [5, 6, 1]. In particular, it has been shown that the mechanism of the chemiluminescent reaction Ba + N20 → {BaO} + N2{ΔH} = -4.1 {eV} is not substantially affected by the presence of the reaction medium.},

	abstract = {Helium (He) nanodroplets irradiated by intense near-infrared laser pulses form a nanoplasma by avalanche-like electron impact ionizations ({EIIs}) even at lower laser intensities where He is not directly field ionized, provided that the droplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons for the {EII} avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and xenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization avalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons from the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier for ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant cations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric field. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed electrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting {EIIs} of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away. The dopants’ ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the slingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a dependence of the dopants’ ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we develop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of dopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the He atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the distribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays between the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for calcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to deshield the dopant ions.},

	abstract = {After their introduction to space physics in the mid 1980s time-of-flight ({TOF}) spectrographs have become a main staple in spaceborne mass spectrometry. They have largely replaced magnetic spectrometers, except when extremely high mass resolution is required to identify complex molecules, for example, in the vicinity of comets or in planetary atmospheres. In combination with electrostatic analyzers and often solid state detectors, {TOF} spectrographs have become key instruments to diagnose space plasma velocity distributions, mass, and ionic charge composition. With a variety of implementation schemes that also include isochronous electric field configurations, {TOF} spectrographs can respond to diverse science requirements. This includes a wide range in mass resolution to allow the separation of medium heavy isotopes or to simply provide distributions of the major species, such as H, He, and O, to obtain information on source tracers or mass fluxes. With a top-hat analyzer at the front end, or in combination with deflectors for three-axis stabilized spacecraft, the distribution function of ions can be obtained with good time resolution. Most recently, the reach of {TOF} ion mass spectrographs has been extended to include energetic neutral atoms. After selecting the arrival direction with mechanical collimation, followed by conversion to ions, adapted {TOF} sensors form a new branch of the spectrograph family tree. We review the requirements, challenges, and implementation schemes for ion and neutral atom spectrographs, including potential directions for the future, while largely avoiding overlap with complementary contributions in this special issue.},

The triumph of this method emanates from the high densities produced in relation to other methods, however beam density remains fundamentally limited by interference with shock waves reflected from collimating surfaces. Here we show experimentally that this shock interaction can be reduced or even eliminated by cryo-cooling the interacting surface. An increase in beam density of nearly an order of magnitude was measured at the lowest surface temperature, with no further fundamental limitation reached. Visualization of the shock waves by plasma discharge and reproduction with direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations both indicate that the suppression of the shock structure is partially caused by lowering the momentum flux of reflected particles, and significantly enhanced by the adsorption of particles to the surface. We observe that the scaling of beam density with source pressure is recovered, paving the way to order of magnitude brighter cold molecular beams.},

	abstract = {Atoms exposed to intense light lose one or more electrons and become ions. In strong fields, the process is predicted to occur via tunnelling through the binding potential that is suppressed by the light field near the peaks of its oscillations. Here we report the real-time observation of this most elementary step in strong-field interactions: light-induced electron tunnelling. The process is found to deplete atomic bound states in sharp steps lasting several hundred attoseconds. This suggests a new technique, attosecond tunnelling, for probing short-lived, transient states of atoms or molecules with high temporal resolution. The utility of attosecond tunnelling is demonstrated by capturing multi-electron excitation (shake-up) and relaxation (cascaded Auger decay) processes with subfemtosecond resolution.},

In the case of fission of highly excited uranium-like and transuranium nuclei, X-ray-fission fragment coincidence technique gives similar timescales a10-18 sec, contradicting much shorter timescales obtained from nuclear techniques.

	abstract = {The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of chirped pulse amplification ({CPA}) along with the development of high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 1018W/cm2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The {CPA} method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification, in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse ones. In addition to this, other effects may occur, including relativistic focusing, relativistic transparency, nonlinear modulation and multiple harmonic generation, and strong coupling to matter and other fields (such as high-frequency radiation). A proper utilization of these phenomena and effects leads to the new technology of relativistic engineering, in which light-matter interactions in the relativistic regime drives the development of laser-driven accelerator science. A number of significant applications are reviewed, including the fast ignition of an inertially confined fusion target by short-pulsed laser energy and potential sources of energetic particles (electrons, protons, other ions, positrons, pions, etc.). The coupling of an intense laser field to matter also has implications for the study of the highest energies in astrophysics, such as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, with energies in excess of 1020eV. The laser fields can be so intense as to make the accelerating field large enough for general relativistic effects (via the equivalence principle) to be examined in the laboratory. It will also enable one to access the nonlinear regime of quantum electrodynamics, where the effects of radiative damping are no longer negligible. Furthermore, when the fields are close to the Schwinger value, the vacuum can behave like a nonlinear medium in much the same way as ordinary dielectric matter expanded to laser radiation in the early days of laser research.},

Femtosecond resolution (1 fs = 10-15 s) is the ultimate achievement for studies of the dynamics of the chemical bond at the atomic level. On this time scale, matter wave packets (particle-type) can be created and their coherent evolution as a single-molecule trajectory can be observed. The field began with simple systems of a few atoms and has reached the realm of the very complex in isolated, mesoscopic, and condensed phases and in biological systems such as proteins and {DNA}.

on a change in electric resistivity of the polymer film as function of the amount of swelling caused by the presence of the
analyte chemical compound. The amount of swelling depends upon the chemical composition of the polymer and the analyte molecule.
The pattern is unique and it unambiguously identifies the compound. Experimentally determined changes in relative resistivity

The electron signature can be traced back to the ionization of the helium environment by Xe seed electrons. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations suggest a two-step ionization scenario in the Xe−He core−shell system. In contrast to xenon, the experimental signal of the helium ions, as well as low-energy electron emission show a deviating delay dependence, indicating diﬀerences in the temporal and spacial development of the charge state distribution of Xe core and He surrounding.

	abstract = {A new method for the reconstruction of velocity maps from ion images is presented, which is based on the maximum entropy concept. In contrast to other methods used for Abel inversion the new method never applies an inversion or smoothing to the data. Instead, it iteratively finds the map which is the most likely cause for the observed data, using the correct likelihood criterion for data sampled from a Poissonian distribution. The entropy criterion minimizes the information content in this map, which hence contains no information for which there is no evidence in the data. Two implementations are proposed, and their performance is demonstrated with simulated and experimental data: Maximum Entropy Velocity Image Reconstruction ({MEVIR}) obtains a two-dimensional slice through the velocity distribution and can be compared directly to Abel inversion. Maximum Entropy Velocity Legendre Reconstruction ({MEVELER}) finds one-dimensional distribution functions Ql(v) in an expansion of the velocity distribution in Legendre polynomials l(cos θ) for the angular dependence. Both {MEVIR} and {MEVELER} can be used for the analysis of ion images with intensities as low as 0.01 counts per pixel, with {MEVELER} performing significantly better than {MEVIR} for images with low intensity. Both methods perform better than {pBASEX}, in particular for images with less than one average count per pixel.},
