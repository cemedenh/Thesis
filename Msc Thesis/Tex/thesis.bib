	abstract = {Laser excitation of nanometer-sized atomic and molecular clusters offers various opportunities to explore and control ultrafast many-particle dynamics. Whereas weak laser fields allow the analysis of photoionization, excited-state relaxation, and structural modifications on these finite quantum systems, large-amplitude collective electron motion and Coulomb explosion can be induced with intense laser pulses. This review provides an overview of key phenomena arising from laser-cluster interactions with focus on nonlinear optical excitations and discusses the underlying processes according to the current understanding. A general survey covers basic cluster properties and excitation mechanisms relevant for laser-driven cluster dynamics. Then, after an excursion in theoretical and experimental methods, results for single-photon and multiphoton excitations are reviewed with emphasis on signatures from time- and angular-resolved photoemission. A key issue of this review is the broad spectrum of phenomena arising from clusters exposed to strong fields, where the interaction with the laser pulse creates short-lived and dense nanoplasmas. The implications for technical developments such as the controlled generation of ion, electron, and radiation pulses will be addressed along with corresponding examples. Finally, future prospects of laser-cluster research as well as experimental and theoretical challenges are discussed.},

Analytical and numerical calculations are employed and compared in order to determine the plasmonic fields in gold ellipsoidal nanoparticles. The comparison indicates that numerical calculations can accurately predict the field enhancement and plasmonic decay, but may encounter difficulties when attempting to predict the oscillatory behavior of the plasmonic field. Numerical calculations for coupled symmetric and asymmetric ellipsoids for different carrier-envelope phases ({CEPs}) of the driving laser field are combined with time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations to predict the resulting {HHG} spectra. The studies reveal that the plasmonic field oscillations, which are controlled by the {CEP} of the driving laser field, play a more important role than the nanostructure configuration in finding the optimal conditions for the generation of isolated attosecond {XUV} pulses via nanoplasmonic field enhancement.},

Thus the helium-droplet technique combines the benefits of both the gas phase and the classical matrix-isolation techniques. Most important, the superfluid helium facilitates binary encounters, and absorbs the released binding energy upon recombination. Thus the droplet can be viewed as an isothermal nanoscopic reactor, which isolates single molecules, clusters, or even a single reactive encounter at ultralow temperatures.},

	abstract = {The infrared spectrum of single oxygen carbon sulfide ({OCS}) molecules was measured inside large superfluid pure helium-4 droplets and nonsuperfluid pure helium-3 droplets, both consisting of about 104 atoms. In the helium-4 droplets, sharp rotational lines were observed, whereas in helium-3 only a broad peak was found. This difference is interpreted as evidence that the narrow rotational lines, which imply free rotations, are a microscopic manifestation of superfluidity. Upon addition of 60 helium-4 atoms to the pure helium-3 droplets, the same sharp rotational lines were found; it appears that 60 is the minimum number needed for superfluidity.},

	abstract = {Although helium is normally a liquid to absolute zero, it can be solidified by the application of moderately high pressures. This transformation is of particular interest, since by the third law of thermodynamics the entropy difference between the liquid and the solid must disappear as the absolute zero is approached. This can most easily be shown by the disappearance of the heat of melting. Measurements from 1.0° to 1.8° of the slope of the melting pressure curve and the change in the molar volume of helium on melting are described, from which the heat of melting and the change in internal energy on melting were calculated. These results verify the predictions made by the third law. The measurements are also combined with those due to earlier workers to show the discontinuities in the various thermodynamic functions at the intersection of the λ-point-pressure curve with the melting pressure curve.},

	abstract = {Based on the idea that a scientific journal is also an “agora” (Greek: market place) for the exchange of ideas and scientific concepts, the history of thermodynamics between 1800 and 1910 as documented in the Philosophical Magazine Archives is uncovered. Famous scientists such as Joule, Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Clausius, Maxwell or Boltzmann shared this forum. Not always in the most friendly manner. It is interesting to find out, how difficult it was to describe in a scientific (mathematical) language a phenomenon like “heat”, to see, how long it took to arrive at one of the fundamental principles in physics: entropy. Scientific progress started from the simple rule of Boyle and Mariotte dating from the late eighteenth century and arrived in the twentieth century with the concept of probabilities. Thermodynamics was the driving intellectual force behind the industrial revolution, behind the enormous social changes caused by this revolution. The history of thermodynamics is a fascinating story, which also gives insights into the mechanism that seem to govern science.},
