\section{Introduction}

Physicists have always wonder to explain and resolve dynamic processes in short scale times, so initial conditions of processes can be  describe in a time  evolution scale. Describe any system like this requires to acquire data in shorter windows of time, for example a film is only a consecutive sequence of  photographs that recreate a large time laps in a smaller time scale pics. For  atomic physics, we are talking about a micro-cosmos that varies from microseconds, i.e several bodies dynamics, to  attoseconds  for atoms,where time scales can go down to $10^{-9}$ $s$, requiring to create measurement methods capable to record in shorter time, while the experiment have to be done in a controllable way to ensures its reproductivility, as any scientific method.

The time window of dynamics of a sytem is related to  quantum dynamics, in a simple view also to its size. For dynamics happening in a molecule or a many body system interaction, the time window can oscillate between  microseconds to fentoseconds, although for millielectronvolt-scale $(meV)$ energy spacing of vibrational energy levels implies that molecular vibrations occur on a time scale of tens to hundreds of femtoseconds. The motion of individual electrons in semiconductor nanostructures, molecular orbitals, and the inner shells of atoms occurs on progressively shorter intervals of time ranging from tens of femtoseconds to less than an attosecond. Motion within nuclei is predicted to unfold even faster, typically on a zeptosecond time scale.

To achive this higth resolution in space and  time physicist have challenged to create systems with a well controlled spatial and temporal gradient. Fortunately nowadays, laser pulses can research up to extreme non-linear optical processes, produccing single aisolated  pulses of ultra violet(UV) waves as short as 67 $as$ \cite{zhao_tailoring_2012}.  Such fast pulses open up the possibility of time resolved measurements fort short processes like electron dynamics.  However, to do this, experimental schemes must be devised that allow these new light sources to be used to perform measurements on the microcosmos. In particular, in the last few years,  many studies at atom- and molecule-clusters had been published, From mid-infre red (NIR) interaction to UV or XUV pulses, that not just lead to a broad spectra to study but also to a large range of possible applications such as the generation of  energetic electrons and ions in the keV-regime \cite{fennel_laser-driven_2010}, as well as intensive XUV and attosecond pulses \cite{stebbings_generation_2011}. Laser pulses with peak intensitiesof up to $10^{21}$ $W/cm^{2}$  are available nowadays \cite{mikaberidze_atomic_1981} commercially so the difficulty and expensive of the experiments source also are easy.

But this is never enough, Lasers is just one huge step in order to control and ignite atomic processes in controlled standard. Other step needed is how to acquire the information we want. For this purpose several techniques are available  depending the nature of the process. For this particular  work we are interested in two  techniques, Velocity map image (VMI) and Time of flight (TOF).
Since its invention, this techniques  has become two of the most commune and important measurement techniques in high energies physics.

But detecting a signal is just one part of the job, the new laser advances like the  generation of coherent high-intensity laser pulses with intensities up to $10^{22} W/cm^{2}$  allow multiphoton ionization that allows to get time resolved measurements. These advances have enabled the development of new research areas, as well as the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in highly excited matter to nanometer size.

In this thesis we focus our efforts  on the ionization process by Mid Infrared (MIR) femtosecond pulses in doped $He$ clusters. The interaction of the dopant with the Laser field result in a energy transfer to the droplet that ignite a ionization process, known as a nanoplasma. This resonant interaction of the laser field with a collective oscillation of the electrons in the plasma is driven by the laser field \cite{fennel_laser-driven_2010}. This process, caused predominantly by electron impact ionization, makes an avalanche-like ionization of the atoms in the cluster, leading to a heating of the plasma and, as a result, to hydrodynamic expansion and Coulomb explosion. To the analysis of this process we studied the electrons as well as the ion's resulting in the coulomb explosion. A velocity map imaging and a Time of flight technique are set up in parallel to acquire the data and reconstruct the initial energies and configuration of the plasma in study. 
In the First chapter we will present a brief introduction to the Droplet He generation, a short plasma interactions as a basic background of coulomb ionization in order to understand the physical meaning.
In the second chapter a more detailed explanation of the set-up used is done. Showing from the creation of the He droplets process to its detection , going thorough the doping, and ignition process.
For the third chapter a detailed explanation on the correlation method for the VMI-TOF measurements is done, and showing the set-up of the data acquisition and its advantages.
In the fourth chapter we present the correlated data and its analysis. Finally the last chapter we present the conclusion of the experiment itself also as the data analysis and future works will needed to improve this process as well.
